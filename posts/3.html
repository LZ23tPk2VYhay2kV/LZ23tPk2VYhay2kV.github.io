        Jonny looks around, confused, his train of thought disrupted. He collects himself and stares at the teacher with a steady eye.<br><br>

        "I want to code demos," he says, his words becoming stronger and more confident as he speaks.<br><br>

        "I want to write something that will change people’s perception of reality. I want them to walk away from the computer dazed, unsure of their footing and eyesight. I want to write something that will reach out of the screen and grab them, make their heartbeats and breathing slow to almost a halt. I want to write something they are reluctant to leave, knowing that nothing they experience that day will be quite as real, as insightful, as good. I want to write demos."<br><br>

        Silence. The class and the teacher stare at Jonny, stunned. It is the teacher’s turn to be confused. Jonny blushes, feeling that something more is required. “Either that or I want to be a fireman.”<br><br>
