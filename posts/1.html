        Documenta Done was an act of artistic piracy that highlighted net art’s uneasy relationship with institutions and archives.

        In the mid-1990s, a network of artists, including Ljubljana-based Vuk Ćosić, came together at conferences and on mailing lists to develop the concept of “net.art.” A number of these artists were involved in documenta X, the 1997 edition of the major exhibition held every five years in Kassel, Germany. Following the exhibition, the news circulated that the exhibition’s website, which included browser-based art and online forums, would be taken offline and sold as a CD-ROM.

        Ćosić quickly copied most of the documenta X site to his own server, Ljudmila.org, and circulated a mostly fake press release about his act, pinning the blame on an “Eastern European hacker.” An artistic ready-made and a prankish gesture of institutional critique, the copy of documenta X serves as a testament to the way in which meaning and memory are contested online, and the difficulties of adapting this informal process to an institutional context.
