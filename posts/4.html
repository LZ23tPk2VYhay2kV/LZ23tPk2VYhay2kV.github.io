        <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/4/23/2961601/0-day-art-digital-art-torrents-piracy">net art warez group</a> that releases net art from paid platforms such as c.r.e.a.m. in torrents, seems to be inactive idk i havent searched tpb that closely (they shouldve just hosted the torrent file themselves!)
